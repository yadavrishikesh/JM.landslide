\title{Density Function of a Univariate Truncated Normal Distribution}
\usage{
dtnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, a = -Inf, b = Inf, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of observations at which the density is to be evaluated.}

\item{mean}{A numeric scalar representing the location parameter (mean) of the normal distribution. Default is 0.}

\item{sd}{A positive numeric scalar representing the scale parameter (standard deviation) of the normal distribution. Default is 1.}

\item{a}{A numeric value specifying the lower bound of truncation. Default is \code{-Inf}.}

\item{b}{A numeric value specifying the upper bound of truncation. Default is \code{Inf}.}

\item{log}{A logical value indicating whether to return the log density. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of density (or log density) values for the truncated normal distribution evaluated at \code{x}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the density (or log density) of a univariate normal distribution that has been truncated to a specified interval. The density is adjusted for the truncation bounds, and the mean and standard deviation of the distribution are provided as parameters.
}
\details{
The function utilizes the \code{TruncatedNormal} package to efficiently compute the normalizing constant, ensuring accurate density values even for intervals with extreme truncation.

If both \code{a} and \code{b} are finite, the function computes the truncated normal density adjusted by the log of the normalizing constant. In cases where one bound is infinite, it defaults to the standard normal distribution behavior.

\examples{
# Evaluate the density of a truncated normal distribution
set.seed(123)
x <- seq(-2, 2, length.out = 100)
density <- dtnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, a = -1, b = 1)
plot(x, density, type = "l", main = "Density of Truncated Normal Distribution")

# Evaluate the log density of the truncated normal distribution
log_density <- dtnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, a = -1, b = 1, log = TRUE)
plot(x, log_density, type = "l", main = "Log Density of Truncated Normal Distribution")
