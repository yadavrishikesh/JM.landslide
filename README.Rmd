# JM.landslide: Joint Modeling of landsldie Counst and Sizes 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `JM.landslide` package is to demonstrate how to jointly model landslide counts and sizes using a sub-asymptotic distribution for the landslide sizes, following the joint modeling approach of [Yadav et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09156) and [Yadav et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssc/qlad077). The model considers various covariates and spatial dependencies, allowing for an effective analysis of landslide counts and sizes. Briefly, the model is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_i \mid \boldsymbol \eta &\sim \text{Poisson}\left[e_i \exp\{\eta_i\}\right], \quad i=1,\ldots,n; \\
\boldsymbol\eta &= \gamma_1 \mathbf{1}_n + \boldsymbol \beta_1 \mathbf{Z}_{1} + \boldsymbol W_{1} + \boldsymbol \varepsilon_{\eta}; \\
A_j \mid \boldsymbol \mu, \boldsymbol \Theta_A &\sim F_A\left[\cdot;\exp\{\mu_j\},\boldsymbol \Theta_{A}\right], \quad j:Y_j>0; \\
\boldsymbol\mu &= \gamma_2 \mathbf{1}_n + \boldsymbol \beta_2 \mathbf{Z}_{2} + \beta \boldsymbol W_1 + \boldsymbol W_{2} + \boldsymbol \varepsilon_{\mu}.
\end{aligned}
$$




In this model:

- \( \boldsymbol \eta \) represents the linear predictor for landslide counts.
- \( A_j \) denotes the size of landslides.
- \( e_i \) are offset terms, which can be set to one or the specific slope unit area.

Further details about the model can be found in the Yadav et al. (2024) and Yadav et al. (2023)

### Synthetic data Simulation

#### 2. Loading Required Libraries and Data

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(JM.landslide)
library(spdep)
library(INLA)

# Load Wenchuan landslides data
data("Wenchuan_info_used_for_simulation")
```

- **Purpose**: This section loads the necessary R packages and the dataset used for simulation. 
- **Libraries**:
  - `JM.landslide`: Contains functions for joint modeling of landslide data.
  - `spdep`: Provides functions for spatial dependence analysis.
  - `INLA`: Used for approximate Bayesian inference for latent models.

- **Data**: The `Wenchuan_info_used_for_simulation` dataset contains the necessary covariates for the simulation.

#### 3. Creating the Adjacency Graph

```r
# Create adjacency graph file
nb2INLA("adjgraph-sim.txt", poly2nb(shp_selected, queen = FALSE, row.names = shp_selected$SU_ID))
adjacensy <- inla.read.graph(filename = "adjgraph-sim.txt")
```

- **Purpose**: This section generates an adjacency graph based on the spatial structure of the data. 
- **Functionality**:
  - `nb2INLA`: Converts neighborhood structures into a format compatible with INLA.
  - `poly2nb`: Generates a list of neighbors for each spatial polygon.
  - `inla.read.graph`: Reads the adjacency graph file into R for further analysis.

#### 4. Creating the Precision Matrix

```r
# Create the precision matrix
N <- adjacensy$n
diag.Q <- diag(adjacensy$nnbs, N)
A.Q <- matrix(0, nrow = N, ncol = N)
for (i in 1:N) {
  A.Q[i, adjacensy$nbs[[i]]] <- 1
}
Q <- diag.Q - A.Q  # Precision matrix
```

- **Purpose**: This section constructs the precision matrix `Q`, which is crucial for defining the spatial dependency structure of the model.
- **Explanation**:
  - `diag.Q`: Creates a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements represent the number of neighbors for each node.
  - `A.Q`: Initializes an adjacency matrix where connections between nodes are indicated.
  - The final precision matrix `Q` is derived by subtracting the adjacency matrix from the diagonal matrix.

#### 5. Setting Fixed Parameters

```r
# Set fixed parameters
kappa_w1 <- 10
kappa_w2 <- 5
kappa_eta <- 10
kappa_mu <- 5
intercept1 <- 2
intercept2 <- 4
beta <- 1
other.hyper <- list(
  kappa_w1 = kappa_w1,
  kappa_w2 = kappa_w2,
  kappa_eta = kappa_eta,
  kappa_mu = kappa_mu,
  intercept1 = intercept1,
  intercept2 = intercept2,
  beta = beta
)
```

- **Purpose**: This section initializes hyperparameters that will be used in the model.
- **Hyperparameters**: 
  - `kappa_w1`, `kappa_w2`, `kappa_eta`, `kappa_mu`: Precision parameters for the spatial random effects.
  - `intercept1`, `intercept2`, `beta`: Intercept and regression coefficients for the model.

#### 6. Simulating Covariates

```r
# Simulate covariates
Z1 <- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(N, mean = rep(0, 3))
Z2 <- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(N, mean = rep(0, 2))
hyper.mu<- c(20,0.1)

set.seed(1)
beta1 <- runif(ncol(Z1), -1, 1)
beta2 <- runif(ncol(Z2), -1, 1)
```

- **Purpose**: Simulates covariate matrices `Z1` and `Z2` which contain fixed effects for the landslide counts and sizes.
- **Explanation**:
  - `rmvnorm`: Generates multivariate normal random variables.
  - `runif`: Generates uniform random variables for the regression coefficients.

#### 7. Simulating Data

```r
model_type <- "FE"  # Fixed Effects

# Simulate data using the function
set.seed(1)
Sim_mark_data <- sim_mark_function(
  Q = Q,
  hyper.mu =  hyper.mu,
  other.hyper = other.hyper,
  beta1 = beta1, beta2 = beta2,
  Z1 = as.matrix(Z1), Z2 = as.matrix(Z2),
  mark_dist = "eGPD",
  model_type = model_type
)
```

- **Purpose**: This section simulates the landslide count and size data using the specified model.
- **Functionality**:
  - `sim_mark_function`: A custom function that simulates the data based on the defined model, precision matrix, hyperparameters, and covariates.
  
#### 8. Accessing Results

```r
# Access results
Y <- Sim_mark_data$Y
A <- Sim_mark_data$A
mu <- Sim_mark_data$mu
eta <- Sim_mark_data$eta
W1 <- Sim_mark_data$W1
W2 <- Sim_mark_data$W2
```

- **Purpose**: This section extracts the simulated results from the output of the simulation function.
- **Explanation**:
  - `Y`: Simulated landslide counts.
  - `A`: Simulated landslide sizes.
  - `mu`, `eta`: Latent variables representing the predictors for counts and sizes.
  - `W1`, `W2`: Spatially structured latent random effects.



##  Fitting the Model

After simulating the data, we can proceed to fit the model using the MCMC sampler provided in the `JM.landslide` package. This allows us to analyze the simulated landslide counts and sizes, estimating the model parameters based on the generated data.

#### Code to Fit the Model

```r
# Define the model type
model_type <- "jSp"

# Load the simulated data
load(paste0("SimulatedData_", model_type, ".RData"))

# Load the JM.landslide library
library(JM.landslide)

# Access the help documentation for the mcmc_sampler function
?JM.landslide::mcmc_sampler

# Fit the model using the MCMC sampler
outputs <- mcmc_sampler(
  Y = Y,               # Simulated landslide counts
  A = A,               # Simulated landslide sizes
  Z1 = Z1,             # Covariates for counts
  Z2 = Z2,             # Covariates for sizes
  CV = "WS",          # Type of cross-validation (within sample)
  mark_dist = "eGPD", # Distribution of the mark process
  thr.family = "gamma", # Family of the threshold model
  model_type = model_type, # Model type used in the simulation
  adjacensy = adjacensy # Adjacency structure for the spatial model
)
```

#### Explanation
- **Defining the Model Type**: The `model_type <- "jSp"` line specifies that we are working with a joint model with spatial components.

- **Loading the Simulated Data**: The `load(paste0("SimulatedData_", model_type, ".RData"))` command loads the simulated data generated earlier. This allows us to use the simulated counts and sizes in the model fitting process.

- **Loading Required Libraries**: The `library(JM.landslide)` statement loads the `JM.landslide` package, which contains the functions needed for fitting the model.

- **Model Fitting**: The `mcmc_sampler` function is then called to fit the model:
  - **Parameters**:
    - `Y` and `A`: These are the simulated landslide counts and sizes, respectively.
    - `Z1` and `Z2`: Covariate matrices used to model the effects on counts and sizes.
    - `CV`: Specifies the type of cross-validation method used, here set to "WS" for within-sample.
    - `mark_dist`: Indicates the distribution for the mark process, set to "eGPD" (extended Generalized Pareto Distribution).
    - `thr.family`: Specifies the family of the threshold model, in this case, "gamma".
    - `model_type`: Indicates the type of model being used, which aligns with the previously defined `model_type`.
    - `adjacensy`: Provides the adjacency structure for the spatial dependencies in the model.

### 10. Conclusion

With the model now fitted, we can proceed to analyze the results and assess the performance of the simulated data under the chosen model. The MCMC sampler estimates the parameters, allowing us to evaluate the impact of various covariates on landslide occurrences and sizes.

In this vignette, we have demonstrated the complete process from simulating landslide data to fitting a statistical model using the `JM.landslide` package. This structured approach allows researchers to analyze spatial data effectively, accounting for dependencies and covariates.
